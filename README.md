# Structural Building Damage Detection with Deep Learning: Assessment of a State-of-the-Art CNN in Operational Conditions


The pretrained models available in this page are similar to the ones presented in: Structural Building Damage Detection with Deep Learning: Assessment of a State-of-the-Art CNN in Operational Conditions. 

All the (3) available models are related to patch based and binary image classification of building damages. Three main levels of resolution are considered, satellite, aerial and UAV: a zip file for each resolution can be downloaded. The files are .hdf5 format.
The damage information identifiable is mostly debris and rubble piles.

The networks were trained with image patches depicting damaged and non-damaged areas covering more than 20 different locations. The presented models were trained on 80% of the images of a given resolution and using the remainder 20% for validation. More details about the networks, their training procedure and discussion are presented in the paper.
